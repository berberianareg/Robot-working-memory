# Robot_working_memory

## Overview
Introducing a network of spiking neurons with adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire units. 
The formal model combines short-term plasticity (STP) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
A keyboard listener is devised, where users can control, on-the-fly, the duration and configuration of inputs presented to the network.
The script runs in an online fashion, originally designed for robotic implementations.
